# ClothingRadar

Project for the Siacoin / Handshake hackathon.

Demo shopping aggregate site built on Skynet. Intended as a way to show potential experiences that could be built on Skynet.

Uses a small dataset now, but there is an abundance of data out there for this type of usecase. Simply search terms like 'shirt', jacket', etc. and it will feed you clothing items that relate.
